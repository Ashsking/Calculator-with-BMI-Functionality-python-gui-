# Calculator with BMI Feature

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive calculator application developed using Python and Tkinter. The calculator provides standard arithmetic operations, a history log, and an additional feature for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI). The project aimed to enhance the user experience through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Features
- Standard arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- History log to track previous calculations.
- BMI calculator with personalized messages based on BMI values.
- Entry validation to ensure that names in the BMI calculator contain only alphabetic characters.
- Neutral color scheme for an improved aesthetic appearance.
- Keyboard bindings for convenient input of digits and operators.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `calculator.py` script using a Python interpreter.
3. Explore the calculator's features, enter calculations, and use the BMI calculator for health insights.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to Daniel Showalter and Shravan Akula for their guidance and mentorship throughout this project. Their support was crucial in navigating the complexities of GUI development and expanding my skills in Python programming.

## Learning Points
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of building graphical user interfaces using Tkinter. Key learning points include effective use of Tkinter's Toplevel widget for managing multiple windows, event handling, widget styling, grid layout management, and incorporating entry validation for a robust user interface.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback to further enhance this calculator application.
